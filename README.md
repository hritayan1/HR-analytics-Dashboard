# HR-analytics-Dashboard
Creating an HR analytics dashboard using Power BI with the specified Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is a great way to visualize and analyze important HR metrics. Let's break down the summary for each KPI:
Here I have created an dashboard using Power BI. In this project I ve taken 6 KPIs.
## Count of Employees:
Provides a snapshot of the total number of employees in the organization.
Enables quick assessment of workforce size and changes over time.
## Attrition:
Indicates the number of employees who have left the organization during a specific period.
Useful for identifying trends and patterns in employee departures.
## Attrition Rate:
Represents the percentage of employees who have left the organization relative to the total workforce.
A key metric for understanding employee turnover and its impact on the organization.
## Average Age:
Gives insight into the demographic composition of the workforce.
Helps in workforce planning and understanding age-related trends within the organization.
## Average Salary:
Provides a mean value of employee salaries.
Useful for assessing overall compensation levels and identifying disparities.
## Average Years of Service:
Indicates the average tenure of employees within the organization.
Offers insights into employee retention and loyalty.

# Visualization and Analysis
1. Utilize interactive charts and graphs in Power BI to visually represent trends over time.
2. Consider using slicers and filters to allow users to explore data based on specific criteria.
